Data Store should be able to have the following API:
- get_successor_list

Tests:
1. Checking Routing Information is correct
2. Check by stopping one node with harmonia_sup:stop(nodename) command

Note:
1. There is always the possibility of timeout failure when calling gen_server:call.
   Because between alival check and gen_server:call, the target node can fail.
