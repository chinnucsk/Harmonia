Performance Consideration:
1. all key fields are stored in index table(this table is created for each table), and this index table is stored on one node(index data is concentrated)
2. all fields are stored in global table which is common for all table.
3. from 1 and 2, space needed is [(key fields)*2 + (data fields)]


Tests:
1. Checking Routing Information is correct
2. Check by stopping one node with harmonia_sup:stop(nodename) command

Note:
1. There is always the possibility of timeout failure when calling gen_server:call.
   Because between alival check and gen_server:call, the target node can fail.
